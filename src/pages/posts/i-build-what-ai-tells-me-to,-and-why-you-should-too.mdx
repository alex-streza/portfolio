# I Build What AI Tells Me To, And Why You Should Too

## AI as a Service

Ideas are hard to come by, great ideas are rare but it doesn’t have to be like that. AI, the utterly **abstract black box of endless creativity and wisdom** can sometimes be of great aid at building the foundation of unicorn company in it’s infancy. A while back I stopped stressing over the unfathomably large todo list by relaxing in the uncanny sight of AI based Idea Generators.

# An Overly Complicated Introduction

> The As A Service Fiesta

The era of other-worldly acronyms, present all around the web, the SaaS, PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and CaaS (Containers-as-a-Service) got so overcrowded SaaS stands not only for Software as a Service but also [Sleep as a Service](https://nikhilthota.medium.com/sleep-as-a-service-saas-e0efa0924297) and the mysterious [Service as a Service](https://www.ft.com/content/f88bc87a-0e4b-11e2-8b92-00144feabdc0).

A software developer’s career splits into several stages from learning the basics, followed by the dreaded 9 to 5 corporate job and ending with the never-ending dream of launching the next **unicorn**, dragon, fox or whatever it’s called nowadays.

I don’t really agree with this way of limiting the interests of an individual to a singular scope like finishing university, I may be biased but the importance of juggling multiple endeavours simultaneously far exceeds the benefits of becoming a **master** of a certain subject.

That lead me to looking into hobbies I can pursue in my free time and week-ends, hobbies that lead me right here telling an oversized computer AI with a TDEE greater than the Bitcoin network’s electricity consumption to make my ideas a reality.

During my constant search for the next cool platform, tool or library I can dip my bruised gym rat fingers in, I discovered the marvels of AI.

I’m not saying AI is the next big thing, it already is but what I am saying is AI can help you with your ideas, it can give you a nudge in the right direction or a gigantic leap. It all depends on how you use it. This paragraph and article is in fact generated with AI 🤖.

# AI as a Service

> No robot revolution imminent

I mentioned earlier the unsettling **Service as a Service**, the concept of architecting a solution that generates solutions, this would leave a lot of us without jobs but that’s a far fetched idea, for now.

Artificial intelligence as a service (**AIaaS**) refers to off-the-shelf AI products that allow businesses to implement and scale AI approaches for a fraction of the cost of a full-fledged AI department.

The AI services I’m talking about are much more grounded in reality but even these are not without their flaws. I see AI as an instrument not a replacement for my own work, an overly complex and ambiguous tool that can indeed boost **productivity**.

Although there are some factual flaws, one in particular is often mentioned whenever you bring up AI generating ideas, that the idea may turn to be complete nonsense or saddeningly **mundane**.

I got to agree with such opinions since an ‘App to record the movements of fireflies using blockchain technology’ is both peculiar and awesome but truly not desired by anyone, yet it’s one of the many suggestions my [**GenIdea**](https://www.genidea.app/) comes up with.

Starting ideas purely generated by artificial intelligence can present some disadvantages and if ignored can lead to **glorious failures**.

Be wary if the project you want to develop is serious to check the potential red flags an AI generated idea may present.

1.  Ask yourself, ‘Does the idea truly **solve** anything?’
2.  Ask yourself, ‘Am I **passionate** enough to buld it?’
3.  **Validate** the idea with an audience

I created [GenIdea](https://www.genidea.app/) because an AI told me to, maybe to breed out more AI to conquer the world or just a random suggestion, it wasn’t easy nor was it the outstanding no. 1 product of the day on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/genidea).

If you build ideas before you check their validity you are unlikely to garner a lot of interest but you’ll gain a lot of experience, **failing once** isn’t bad. It’s better to start an idea and build it than continue to promise you will someday, let AI choose your next project.

Hope you liked this short “AI” story, don’t forget to clap **👏** and follow for more software-related content 🚀.
