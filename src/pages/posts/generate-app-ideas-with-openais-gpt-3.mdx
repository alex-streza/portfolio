# Productâ€™s infancy

Every product whether itâ€™s a SaaS, PaaS, DaaS (donut as a service app incoming), or a physical product was in its infancy an innocent idea brought in the hands of builders and innovators.

SaaS Nowadays

My desire was to build something that helps others build and many faces the dreaded lack of an idea, so I researched tools to cut down brainstorming to simple swipes and taps and none was truly marvelous.

I built [**GenIdea**](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/genidea), an [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) GPT-3 powered web app that will soon boost everyoneâ€™s inspiration and creativity to the next level (so I hope). Also launched it on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/genidea) so feel free to give feedback,

Right now we are launching it in the demo phase to gather signups and will soon release a Roadmap for many upcoming features (true idea generation, project building & many others).

# Productâ€™s demo

Check the brand new homepage and start generating ideas like a million-dollar unicorn on PEDs.

As an extra touch, we are also suggesting a list of technologies to get you started on your app in no time. We are a bit biased to JavaScript frameworks but will soon include more techs.

# Upcoming Updates

Iâ€™m planning a release for **March 1st** which will open up the account creation for free and paid tiers. Once you have an account youâ€™ll have the chance to generate never before seen ideas according to your plan.

## Account Creation

Authentication will be done through [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) & [GitHub OAuth](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) after which youâ€™ll be automatically given the free tier 10 ideas/month.

Those ideas will be taken from the pool of already generated ideas and not claimed by paying users.

## Plan Selection

If you truly want to experience the AI at its finest choose either the Standard or Premium subscription plans which grant 100 / 500 ideas per month which should cover all your brainstorming needs.

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) will be used as a payment processor for smooth integration and payment experience.

## Search Ideas

Discover ideas generated by others and even join/support them to build the idea they published. Only ideas generated by paying users can be published for others to see and support.

Use filters such as preferred tech stacks, keywords, and many more.

Thatâ€™s it for now but I hope to return with many more features and even more in-depth guides on some of the things to check when launching a **SaaS**, donâ€™t forget to clap and follow for more software-related contentðŸš€.
