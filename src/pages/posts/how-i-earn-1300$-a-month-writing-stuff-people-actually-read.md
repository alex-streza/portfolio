# How I Earn 1300$ A Month Writing Stuff People Actually Read

## Not an everyday writer

No, I’m not selling courses or e-books, nor am I some sort of “guru” and my lovely audience is not in the tens of thousands. I’m just a regular person, who figured out how to make some bucks by writing articles people actually **want to read**.

For parts of the world, $1300 is pocket change, whereas for others, it’s a small fortune. Being able to generate this amount of money while creating articles that take a few hours a week is simply marvelous.

By day I work as a developer, and by night I write and learn as much as I can to become a jack of all trades but a master of none, I promise that’s the final poetic cringe you’ll encounter in this article.

# I Don’t Write Tutorials (Coding) Anymore

> I Code

Don’t get me wrong, coding and tech tutorials are great, but the web is oversaturated with boring articles covering the same commonly used tools people are already very accustomed to.

I did my fair share of tutorials, with some of them being decently popular due to placing highly in Google Searches. It’s good to note that most blogs monetize the in-app read time of an article not views or reads from search engines or social media shares.

My first article was a tutorial and I was so proud I got a mere 4**0 views** and **36 cents** for 3 hours of work and research, don’t falter if things are not going to the moon from the very start, and in 6 months this happened:

If you want people to read your work, you need to stand out, and the best way to do that is by writing about things nobody else is talking about, or taking a new angle on an existing topic. The more out-of-the-box your thinking is, the more people will want to read what you have to say.

If you still want to make coding blogs be careful choosing your title, clickbait is bad unless it’s real, wanna write about some animation library? Instead of “How To Animate X Library” write something like “Animation Was Hard Until I Discovered X”, make the article a tad personal so readers will consider it more relatable and genuine.

Many writers claim success is correlated with finding the right **niche**, audience and keep a **consistent** output of articles, they are fair advice but not for someone just starting out. Try as many topics as you can if you find a writing style/subject that gets viral make sure to capitalize on it as much as possible.

Scheduling articles is hard but for starters try to write 2–4 articles a month, it isn’t a lot but the goal is to build a habit of writing, with Medium you can also schedule to post an article at a certain date and hour which is extremely helpful to maintain **schedule**.

Last month I achieved over $1340 and the main reason for that was hitting the viral jackpot with one of [my articles](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/i-deep-faked-myself-in-every-meeting-for-a-whole-week-23901deed017) that’s responsible for a bit more than half of that revenue. You never truly know which article will perform best or when but those previous steps I’ve covered were, in my humble opinion a big factor.

# I Use AI To Speed Up Everything

> I Love Productivity Tools

I think this is insanely obvious, I am an AI geek and love nothing more than automating everything I possibly can from coding to blog writing and content creation.

I’ve been trying out [**Jasper**](https://jasper.ai/) for the past few articles as it’s a gorgeous platform for AI text content generation. It has a long form text editor similar to other platforms but with a twist, you can use AI at your fingertips to help you write your content.

Jasper AI

Some people use AI to generate ideas, I prefer having my titles be entirely human generated and then using AI to power through the rest. One thing to note is to not use such AI for facts but rather to defeat writer’s blocks and speed up the entire creation process. People create content, AI only assists.

When it comes to coding, I found out a large part of my code is repetitive and could be automated so I started using a mix of extensions for VSCode, such as [TabNine Autocomplete](https://www.tabnine.com/?utm_term=&utm_source=google.com&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=14854202152&utm_content=) and the almighty [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) which I’ve reviewed in the past.

For an outsider coding is an enigma but often daily tasks are reduced to rewriting some code or adding a similar functionality elsewhere and that’s where AI excels at, it takes existing code in consideration and helps you finish up faster than you could say “NFTs are a scam”.
