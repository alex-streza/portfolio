# JavaScript Date Libraries Showdown

## Moment vs. Luxon vs. Date-fns vs. DayJS

Manipulating dates is one of the most complex topics to be handled in any application. Timezones, localization and formatting dates are few of the tasks a date library should provide and now Iâ€™m gonna list a few packages which make date manipulation a piece of ðŸŽ‚.

# 1\. [Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon)

Developed by some of the people maintaining Moment itâ€™s a lighter, immutable library which doubled its popularity since the â€˜deprecationâ€™ of Moment as itâ€™s little over 1.7M downloads/week on NPM.

It provides many ways of manipulating dates, intervals, and timezones but can be pretty heavy for smaller projects.

# 2\. [Date-FNS](https://date-fns.org/)

Basically lodash for dates, small bundle size, and easy-to-use functions for any possible scenario.

I really like date-fns both due to its API being similar to lodash utilitites but also that all manipulations are directly applied to a JS Date object.

# 3.[DayJS](https://day.js.org/)

Extremely tiny at only 2Kb bundled and according to bundlephobia itâ€™s 26 times smaller than moment which is mind-boggling and several counts smaller than the other 2 in this list.

# 4\. [MomentJS](https://momentjs.com/)

With over 15M downloads as of writing this article, Moment may still seem to be GOAT, but its API belongs to a different era of JS due to a mutable design.

Still, so many older projects list Moment as a dependency, therefore, its status has been changed to **maintenance** and will not be receiving any more updates according to [Moment Project Status](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/).

Letâ€™s see how we can do some basic operations using the old lad moment:
