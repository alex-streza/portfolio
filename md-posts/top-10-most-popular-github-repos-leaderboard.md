# Top 10 Most Popular GitHub Repos Leaderboard

## React isn‚Äôt number one?

What makes an open-source project **stand out** in the sea of repos isn‚Äôt really a **mystery**. Let‚Äôs find out what are the most starred repositories out there and what may have helped them reach such numbers.

free vs. paid learning resources

# 1\. [freeCodeCamp / freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) (‚≠ê341k )

> Everyone loves free stuff

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*1vAGDj7kRHWPqol7Av_-jg.png)

freeCodeCamp GitHub Repo

It‚Äôs impossible you haven‚Äôt heard of freeCodeCamp but you may not know it‚Äôs the most starred repository in GitHub.

Several free developer certificates are available at [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Each of these certifications requires you to complete five compulsory web app projects as well as hundreds of optional code tasks to help you prepare for them.

The plethora of free educational information they provide is simply astounding and the main reason they are number one.

Giving away **free** learning resources for coding in the golden age is definitely the main factor for their popularity since people love free resources & advice.

# 2\. [996icu/996.ICU](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU) (‚≠ê261k)

> Work / life balance saver

996.ICU GitHub Repo

Honestly, I had no idea this repo even existed but it certainly is **useful** beyond anything.

The term 996.ICU comes from the Chinese phrase ‚ÄúWork by ‚Äò996‚Äô, sick in ICU,‚Äù which indicates that adhering to the ‚Äú996‚Äù work schedule (9 a.m. ‚Äî 9 p.m 6 days a week) puts you at danger of being admitted to the ICU (Intensive Care Unit).

The repository contains multiple lists from Chinese companies not forcing 996 schedules to covering awesome repositories.

# 3\. [EbookFoundation / free-programming-books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) (‚≠ê222k)

> Free continues to be king

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*wUFlu5BXaSV8hjIoW4UzFw.png)

[EbookFoundation Website](https://ebookfoundation.github.io/)

It‚Äôs extremely straightforward what this project does, it lists books and other resources grouped by languages & genres. You can find books in over 36 languages and courses in more than 28.

Seems revealing free educational information to the world is key to a repositories popularity.

# 4\. [jwasham/coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) (‚≠ê210k)

> FAANG interviews solved

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*uWRxN5Jt1ykRu6bYLWt3xw.png)

coding-interview-university GitHub Repo

You likely heard the saying ‚Äúin tech interviews are **harder** than the actual job‚Äù, and it‚Äôs pretty much spot on, getting ready for an interview at a FAANG company is rather mind-boggling.

The repository covers exactly the steps to getting ready for a hard coding interview so make your interviewers utterly astounded at your data structures and algorithms knowledge.

‚ÄòSelling‚Äô a dream or providing it for free is a sure-fire way to achieving popularity on the internet.

# 5\. [vuejs/vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) (‚≠ê193k)

> Wait React isn‚Äôt the most popular web frontend framework?

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*uo5vlzBP-480hSNpbrhOHw.png)

Vue.JS Website

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is a progressive framework for creating user interfaces (pronounced /**vju**/, like view). It was built from the ground up to be gradually adaptable, and it can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on the needs.

It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.

It‚Äôs simple and easy to learn API, great documentation and a friendly community are likely reasons for its success.

# 6\. [sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) (‚≠ê190k)

> Awesome is awesome

Consists of a list of many free & premium resources and platforms related to tech from Programming Languages, Databases to even Security & Blockchain.

A cool trick I found out recently is if you want high-quality, curated information in most tech stacks you just search awesome-'tech' GitHub repo and you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised.

# 7\. [kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) (‚≠ê187k)

> Career roadmaps everywhere

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*QTWqyKBiG_9fSD68miGQVg.png)

[roadmap.sh Website](https://roadmap.sh/)

Nowadays everyone wants to **get started** with programming but because of so many resources and lack of guidance, they get sidetracked.

This repository provides several developer roadmaps by a specific job position (frontend/backend/DBA‚Ä¶), language (Java/Python/Go‚Ä¶) or tech (React/Angular).

# 8\. [facebook/react](https://github.com/facebook/react) (‚≠ê183k)

> How can React be so low on the leaderboard

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*v-eeW2kXe0F2_yVdHdXp_Q.png)

[React Website](https://reactjs.org/)

Everyone knows what [React](https://reactjs.org/) is whether you like it or hate it, it‚Äôs a **powerful** tool to build web applications quickly and has a nice developer experience for new apps but lacks the guidelines & toolset of a true framework.

Writing React code is mostly satisfying as you have access to a plethora of solid, community-built packages on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) which complete the React ecosystem.

# 9\. [tensorflow/tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) (‚≠ê163k)

> Robots everywhere

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ef2V2xb2r1Wo0c_7nb4Yig.png)

[TensorFlow Website](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

[TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is **the platform** for AI/ML/DL, it takes advantage of GPU power and [Nvidia CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) technology to develop & train your AI models as fast as possible. It provides a marvelous API both in Python and C++ and it‚Äôs loved by data scientists worldwide.

Since AI is on a huge ascent in the past few years is expected for such an open-source project to garner attention and popularity.

# 10\. [donnemartin / system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) (‚≠ê162k)

> Architecture is hard, system architecture is harder

One of the **hardest** endeavours in software engineering is designing complex, scalable systems for large applications.

This repository **saves** you the trouble of buying expensive courses by preparing you for system design interviews through several quizzes, interactive coding challenges, and countless links to free resources.

# Conclusion

After checking out all of these repositories, we can conclude that a popular open-source project needs at least some of the following features:

- Free learning resources
- Great documentation
- Solution to a problem in field on the rise like AI/ML/Blockchain
