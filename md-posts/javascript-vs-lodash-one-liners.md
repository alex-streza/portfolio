# JavaScript vs Lodash One-Liners

## 5 Lodash Alternatives in Modern JavaScript

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1142/0*OZ8LBrH-0zYmScST)

[Lodash](https://lodash.com/) has been one of the most popular libraries on NPM for a long time with over 30M downloads per week as it brings great utility functions for every projects needs. It was regarded as a must have dependency to every project although this is no longer the case with the introduction of ES6 & Array Methods.

Adding another library to an already steaming node_modules can impact loading speeds and reduce performance that‚Äôs why I choose to no more include lodash in new projects.

I often use [bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/) before adding a new package as it shows both the bundle size footprint and smaller bundled alternatives.

We can see lodash doesn‚Äôt have a giant impact to download time of only ~61ms for 3G but still a better web is made of less JS payloads ü§ì.

All following examples will be on this array:

## 1\. Remove Duplicates

In Lodash it‚Äôs pretty straightforward using `uniqWith` and `isEqual` as comparator, for ES6 we‚Äôll need to check for duplicate objects on each filter iteration.

## 2\. Calculate Average

We need to calculate the average (or mean for Lodash) price of all pets.

## 3\. Random Id

Add a random id to each pet in the array.

> I do not recommend using `Math.random` to generate keys or passwords as it‚Äôs not entirely random, see more about [random numbers](https://www.random.org/randomness/).

## 4\. Capitalize String

For each pet we need to make the first letter upper cased.

## 5\. Remove Field

We‚Äôll remove the price property as we all know üê∂ are priceless.

## Bonus Tip

If you are using Lodash or date-fns import utility functions like this:

That way the import size is considerably reduced unlike importing the entire module:
