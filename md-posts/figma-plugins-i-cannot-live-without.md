# Figma Plugins I Cannot Live Without

## 10 Figma Plugins for Designers and Developers

Whether youâ€™re a designer or a developer, youâ€™ve certainly heard of Figma. Itâ€™s a free tool that allows creating design mockups and prototypes with ease using the core features but also has an amazing Plugin Ecosystem for third-party developers to integrate their APIs or extend the base features.

# [**1\. Iconify**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735098390272716381/Iconify)

Everyone loves icons as theyâ€™ve become an important part of every design. With iconify, you can search for a certain icon from many free icon sets and integrate the SVG into the design in seconds.

> Tip: Use icons from same sets or with similar style (weight).

Iconify Figma Plugin

# [2\. Unsplash](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/738454987945972471/Unsplash)

Beautiful and high-quality images contribute to improving a website's appearance considerably and Unsplash is one of the go-to sites for image assets. This extension integrates Unsplash into Figma to instantly set images on frames.

> Tip: If you right click on an image from the plugin & select multiple frames you can choose different images to be inserted on the selected frames at the same time.

# [3\. LogoFetch](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/827609259425497670/LogoFetch)

This plugin is great for downloading image assets for a certain brand and integrating them in your design.

> Tip: If you need the logos to be SVG format you can use [Vector Logos](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/854152902511629627/Vector-Logos).

# [4\. Similayer](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735733267883397781/Similayer)

What if you are creating a Design System and have added many icons and a developer wants to download all of them? Similayer comes in handy with a ton of options for selecting multiple layers simultaneously.

> Tip: You can select multiple properties to find similar layers at the same time.

# [5\. Lorem Ipsum](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/736000994034548392/Lorem-ipsum)

Everyone knows what Lorem Ipsum is, you can fill up text sections quickly to test the overall look and sizes.

> Tip: Even if you are writing a wireframe try to use appropriate copy text for the product youâ€™re designing.

# [7\. UI Faces](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/769664006254845172/UI-Faces)

Good-looking user images at your fingertips. Similar to Unsplash but this is centered around people images.

> Tip: An alternative would be [Avatars](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739659977030056719/Avatars), although you cannot filter for certain properties like in UI Faces.

# [9\. Tailwind CSS](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/738806869514947558/Tailwind-CSS)

# [10\. Vectary 3D Elements](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/769588393361258724/Vectary-3D-Elements)

3D is all the rage in 2021 as more and more websites adopt interactive 3D experiences as their main branding direction and Vectary 3D helps designers with less experience in modeling to integrate 3D elements in their designs as images.

> Tip: If you are a developer you must try [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/).
